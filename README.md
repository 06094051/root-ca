<h1>Root-CA</h1>
<p>This repo contains scripts to generate SSL-certificates automatically. You only have to put your CA-certifcate into folder <code>certs/</code></p>
<p>To create new SSL-certificate only call the bash-script <code>./newssl.sh &lt;ProjectName&gt;</code> and follow the instructions. A folder <code>ProjectName</code> will be
generated inside the <code>ssl</code> directory containing the private and public SSL-certificates.</p>
